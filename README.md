# Carent-webapp

## Web application made as a final project on post-graduate studies (*Programming of web applications*) on AGH University Of Science and Technology

#### Assumptions
- I chose JEE as my major technology 
  - I couldn't use Spring
  - I had to use Maven
- It should be a CRUD web application, so I decided to use:
  - MySQL
  - JPA/Hibernate
  - Wildfly
- It should have a polished front end (as I do not focus on a visual side, I decided to make only quite simple web pages using bootstrap)

I decided to create an application for car rental service.

#### Final word
It is a very simple application because I have been learning programming during the process of creating it. I barely knew Java EE when I started. This is a lot of things which should be done to make this app really nice and useful e.g.:
 - email verification
 - change of car availability after booking it
 - creating .pdf to order
 but I have a deadline which not allow me to make more complicated things. I plan to make other application with these functionalities (and probably with Spring).
